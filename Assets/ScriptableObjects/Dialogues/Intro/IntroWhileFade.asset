  - What a stressful night..
  - Sometimes I wonder, if I should be switching jobs..
  - To dream of my work meetings for the upcoming week seems to be a bad sign..
  - And why was it some fight against upcoming meetings?
  - The meetings seemed so alive..
  - Almost as if they were trying to invade my calendar..
  - What a truly awful dream.
  - And what an awful concept of a dream at that!
  - Well, no time to worry about all of that now. Time to get up!
